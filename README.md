# CSS Flexbox 

Flexbox makes it easier to build page layouts that are dynamic. As the designer of a web page, you can designate some parts of your page to automatically resize depending on window size, filling empty space in a way that you specify. It is also very useful for displaying columns or rows of items, keeping items evenly spaced regardless of their individual sizes, or allowing them to wrap to a new line cleanly.

In this lesson, we will discuss some of the common ways to use flexbox and the associated properties you can use while coding through some examples. Feel free to code along using the provided html files.

## Mondrian CSS Painting 

Piet Mondrian is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century 

He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th-century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements.
